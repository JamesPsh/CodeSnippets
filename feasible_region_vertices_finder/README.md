# Feasible Region Vertices Finder

This repository contains a Python script to find all vertices of the feasible region defined by a set of linear constraints. This can be useful for linear programming problems where you need to analyze the feasible region's vertices to determine optimal solutions.

## Features

- Finds all intersection points (vertices) of the feasible region.
- Checks if the intersection points satisfy all constraints.
- Handles any set of linear constraints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas

## Installation

To install the required packages, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
